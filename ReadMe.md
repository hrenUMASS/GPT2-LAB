This project focuses on exploring the possibility of extracting relationships from pre-trained large language models. This framework is based on PyTorch and huggingface-transformers, running under Anaconda 4.9 environment. It mainly contains three parts: dataset connectors, models, and processing methods. The dataset connectors are the layer for providing data. It provides several standard universal functions for reading the data from files/databases and splitting the data into several datasets. The models can be any kind of model inherited from the PreTrainedModel class from the huggingface transformers. The processing methods are custom functions that take the model, the data, and a data preprocess function together to read the data from the dataset and process it, then feed the processed data to the model to generate the results. The program is based on modular programming ideology and has used massive higher-order functions, therefore it is very easy to expand this framework to make it feasible for different situations. In this specific research, after this framework has been established, only small pieces of code were required for different tasks.
