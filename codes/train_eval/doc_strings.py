            ``past_key_values[0].shape[-2]`` (``sequence_length`` of input past key value states). Indices of input
            sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

            If :obj:`past_key_values` is used, only ``input_ids`` that do not have their past calculated should be
            passed as ``input_ids``.

            Indices can be obtained using :class:`~transformers.GPT2Tokenizer`. See
            :meth:`transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode` and :meth:`transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__` for

        past_key_values (:obj:`List[torch.FloatTensor]` of length :obj:`config.n_layers`):
            Contains precomputed hidden-states (key and values in the attention blocks) as computed by the model (see
            :obj:`past_key_values` output below). Can be used to speed up sequential decoding. The ``input_ids`` which
            have their past given to this model should not be passed as ``input_ids`` as they have already been
            computed.
        attention_mask (:obj:`torch.FloatTensor` of shape :obj:`(batch_size, sequence_length)`, `optional`):
            Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:

            - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
            - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

        token_type_ids (:obj:`torch.LongTensor` of shape :obj:`(batch_size, input_ids_length)`, `optional`):
            Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in ``[0,
            1]``:

            - 0 corresponds to a `sentence A` token,
            - 1 corresponds to a `sentence B` token.

        position_ids (:obj:`torch.LongTensor` of shape :obj:`(batch_size, sequence_length)`, `optional`):
            Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range ``[0,
            config.max_position_embeddings - 1]``.

        head_mask (:obj:`torch.FloatTensor` of shape :obj:`(num_heads,)` or :obj:`(num_layers, num_heads)`, `optional`):
            Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:

            - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
            - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

        inputs_embeds (:obj:`torch.FloatTensor` of shape :obj:`(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, `optional`):
            Optionally, instead of passing :obj:`input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
            This is useful if you want more control over how to convert :obj:`input_ids` indices into associated
            vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

            If :obj:`past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last :obj:`inputs_embeds` have to be input (see
            :obj:`past_key_values`).
        use_cache (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            If set to :obj:`True`, :obj:`past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up
            decoding (see :obj:`past_key_values`).
        output_attentions (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See ``attentions`` under returned
            tensors for more detail.
        output_hidden_states (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See ``hidden_states`` under returned tensors for
            more detail.
        return_dict (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Whether or not to return a :class:`~transformers.file_utils.ModelOutput` instead of a plain tuple.

PARALLELIZE_DOCSTRING = r"""
    Uses a device map to distribute attention modules of the model across several devices. If no device map is given,
    it will evenly distribute blocks across all devices.

    Args:
        device_map (:obj:`Dict[int, list]`, optional, defaults to None):
            A dictionary that maps attention modules to devices. Note that the embedding module and LMHead are always
            automatically mapped to the first device (for esoteric reasons). That means that the first device should
            have fewer attention modules mapped to it than other devices. For reference, the gpt2 models have the
            following number of attention modules:

                - gpt2: 12
                - gpt2-medium: 24
                - gpt2-large: 36
                - gpt2-xl: 48

    Example::

            # Here is an example of a device map on a machine with 4 GPUs using gpt2-xl, which has a total of 48 attention modules:
            model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2-xl')
            device_map = {0: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],

                          2: [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34],
                          3: [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]}

GPT2_START_DOCSTRING = r"""

    This model inherits from :class:`~transformers.PreTrainedModel`. Check the superclass documentation for the generic
    methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings,
    pruning heads etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch `torch.nn.Module <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module>`__
    subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to
    general usage and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config (:class:`~transformers.GPT2Config`): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the :meth:`~transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained` method to load the model
            weights.
